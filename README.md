# Stock Price Analysis and Forecasting with Web Scraping and Prophet
This project scrapes Tesla's historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using BeautifulSoup, organizing it into a structured dataset suitable for analysis. Visualizations created with Plotly Express highlight trends in stock prices and trading volumes over the past year. Using the Prophet library, a machine learning model is trained on the historical data to forecast stock prices for the next 30 days. Although this project focuses on Tesla, the forecasting and visualization pipeline can be applied to any stock with available historical data. Key steps include web scraping, data cleaning, visualization, model training, and future price prediction, offering insights into stock performance and potential trends.
